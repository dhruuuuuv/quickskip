# QuickSkip: Bypass Webpage Timers

## Overview

QuickSkip is a Chrome extension that automatically detects countdown timers on webpages and attempts to bypass them by enabling the associated button element. This can help users save time and access content more quickly.

## Installation

### Manual Installation

1. Download the ZIP file of this repository and extract it to a folder on your computer.
2. Open Google Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions`.
3. Enable "Developer Mode" by clicking the toggle switch in the top right corner.
4. Click the "Load Unpacked" button and select the folder where you extracted the ZIP file.

Your extension should now be loaded and ready to use!

## Usage

After installation, QuickSkip will automatically run on every webpage you visit. If it detects a countdown timer on a page, it will attempt to enable the associated button.

Note that this extension may not work on all websites. Some websites may use different methods to implement countdown timers, and others may check on the server side to ensure the countdown has completed. 

## Limitations

QuickSkip uses a simple heuristic to detect countdown timers, so it may occasionally produce false positives or fail to detect a timer. If you encounter any issues, please let us know by opening an issue on this GitHub repository.

## Disclaimer

Always respect the terms of service of the websites you visit. Some websites might disallow the type of interaction QuickSkip performs, and using the extension could potentially violate those terms. We are not responsible for any issues arising from the use of QuickSkip.
